1. **Optimized Coconut Fertilizer Management for Assam's Conditions:** This module will focus on the specific nutrient needs of coconut palms in Assam's soil and climate.  It will cover soil testing interpretation, calculating fertilizer requirements based on soil test results, and demonstrating the correct application methods for maximizing nutrient uptake and minimizing nutrient runoff.  The training will include practical demonstrations and examples relevant to Assam's specific coconut varieties.

2. **Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for Coconut in Assam:** This module will detail common coconut pests in Assam, their life cycles, and environmentally sound control methods. It will cover methods like identifying pest infestations early, using natural predators, employing biopesticides, and using chemical pesticides only as a last resort and only when strictly necessary, while highlighting the safe and proper use and disposal of pesticides.  The training will include practical sessions on identifying pests and implementing IPM strategies relevant to Assamâ€™s climate and pest pressures.

3. **Improving Coconut Farm Management Practices:** This module will cover improved agronomic practices for higher yields, including proper spacing of trees, water management techniques (especially important considering Assam's rainfall patterns), efficient harvesting methods, and post-harvest handling to minimize losses.  It will also incorporate the results from the soil testing, advising on practical improvements for the specific soil and farm conditions."
